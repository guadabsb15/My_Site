Welcome to my page!

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/photo2.jpg" alt="Photo" align="right" style="width: 200px;"/>

I am a PhD candidate in the [Physics and Astronomy](http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/) department at Stony Brook University working with the nuclear astrophysics group. As part of my research, I work on hydrodynamics simulations of white dwarfs merging using the AMR code [Castro](http://amrex-astro.github.io/Castro/). Currently, I am contributing to the efforts of including an MHD solver in Castro. My research interests include algortihms implementations and high performance computing.

I care about adressing inclusion of underrepresented groups in STEM. While at Stony Brook, I have collaborated in mentoring undergraduate students, and being part of the graduate women in science and engeneering e-board. Other non academic interests include swiming, dancing and learning about different cultures. 

#### *Previous education*

I did my underdraduate studies in Physics at [Universidad del Valle de Guatemala](http://web.uvg.gt/) and earned a [Global UGRAD](https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/global-undergraduate-exchange-program-global-ugrad) scholarship to do my sophomore year abroad at [North Central College](https://www.northcentralcollege.edu/) in Naperville, IL.
